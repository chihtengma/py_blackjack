# 🃏 Simple Console Blackjack Game

This is a very simple **Blackjack game** that runs in the **Python console**. It's intended for **learning purposes only** and is a great starting point for anyone exploring Python fundamentals like conditionals, loops, functions, and simple game logic.

## 🎯 What it does

- You play against a computer "dealer"
- Cards are randomly drawn from a standard deck
- The dealer hits until reaching 17 or more
- The game handles Ace logic (11 or 1)
- Basic win/lose/draw conditions are implemented
- Includes detection for Blackjack (21 with first two cards)

## 🧠 Why this project

This project is meant for **learning and practice**. It's written in a simple, readable way to make it easy to understand how a game loop, score comparison, and card handling logic work.

## 🚧 Limitations & To-Do

This is a work-in-progress and has a lot of room for improvement:

- No card removal (infinite deck)
- No betting system
- No replay scoreboard or win tracking
- No GUI or web interface
- No handling of soft 17 dealer behavior
- Only one player vs dealer

## 🔄 Future Plans

I’ll continue updating this as I learn more, with plans to add:

- A better deck system (no repeated cards)
- Multiple rounds with a scoreboard
- Betting system with chips
- A GUI version using `tkinter` or maybe even `pygame`

## 🚀 Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python_blackjack.git
   
2. Run it with Python:
